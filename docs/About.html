                            my best friend for years stuggled finding a job. We then thought about opening up a kitchen so I can employee my friend and
                            this turned into a business. Orginally we had only my family working this shop but overtime Fengs food has gotten better so we thought
                            we needed to be as well so we made sure we had the attire to match his cooking skills. "
