# Chinese Website
 This is a medium level project in HTML where I was challanged too make a website for an established Chinese resturant. I've handpicked the images used in this website as well along with my girlfriend personally drawing the back ground art to assist on this project. I do believe I could do better if Given time but for 2 weeks I think I did amazing. 

I've now uploaded the site to github pages so you can review without needing to download the website. The website is buggy and is not a good showcase of my skill as I've done the deployement very fast just as a test before I made my profolio. This webpage was made somewhere in 2022. It also WILL not work on mobile.
