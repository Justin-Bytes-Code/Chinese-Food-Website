# Chinese Website
 This is a medium level project in HTML where I was challanged too make a website for an established Chinese resturant. I've handpicked the images used in this website as well along with my girlfriend personally drawing the back ground art to assist on this project. I do believe I could do better if Given time but for 2 weeks I think I did amazing.
